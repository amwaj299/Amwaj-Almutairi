            <h1 class="Title">ABOUT ME ðŸŒŠ</h1>
            <p class="Pargrph">
                My name is Amwaj Almutairi. I like learning new things, especially in the field of technology and
                programming, because it helps me create, solve problems, and express my ideas in a modern way.

                My academic major is Computer Science, and I enjoy discovering more about coding, web development, and
                how technology can make life easier. I also love creativity and design, because they allow me to combine
                logic with art.

                In addition to technology, I enjoy poetry, music, and reading books. Poetry inspires me with deep
                feelings and beautiful words, music gives me peace and motivation, and reading books opens my mind and
                helps me learn from different ideas and experiences.

                In the future, I would like to continue growing in my field, build useful projects, and leave a positive
                impact through my work.
