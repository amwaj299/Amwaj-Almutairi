                <h1>ABOUT ME </h1>
                <p class="Pargrph">
                    My name is Amwaj Almutairi.
                    The meaning of my name ‚ÄúAmwaj‚Äù in English is ‚Äúwaves‚Äù, which reflects movement, energy, and a calm
                    but powerful spirit. I like learning new things, especially in the field of technology and
                    programming, because it helps me create, solve problems, and express my ideas in a modern way.

                    My academic major is Computer Science, and I enjoy discovering more about coding, web development,
                    and how technology can make life easier. I also love creativity and design, because they allow me to
                    combine logic with art.

                    In addition to technology, I enjoy poetry, music, and reading books. Poetry inspires me with deep
                    feelings and beautiful words, music gives me peace and motivation, and reading books opens my mind
                    and helps me learn from different ideas and experiences.

                    In the future, I would like to continue growing in my field, build useful projects, and leave a
                    positive impact through my work. </p>
